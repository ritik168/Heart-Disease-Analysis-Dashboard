## 📌 Project Title

Heart Disease Survival Analysis Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze heart disease patient data and identify how age, medical indicators, and lifestyle factors affect patient survival, helping healthcare providers take data-driven preventive actions.


## 🔍Business Problems & Answers


1️⃣ What is the overall survival rate of heart disease patients?

The overall survival rate is 67.89%, meaning nearly 68 out of 100 patients survived.


2️⃣ What is the average age of patients who survived?

The average age of survival is 58.76 years, indicating middle-aged patients have higher survival chances.


3️⃣ How many total patients survived and how many died?

Total Survivals: 203 patients

Total Deaths: 96 patients


4️⃣ Which age group has the highest survival count?

The 51–60 age group has the highest survival count (64 patients).


5️⃣ Which age group has the lowest survival count?

Patients aged 71+ have the lowest survival count (21 patients).


6️⃣ How does survival rate change across different age groups?

61–70 years: 75.90% (highest survival rate)

40–50 years: 74.32%

51–60 years: 71.11%

71+ years: 40.38% (lowest survival rate)

👉 Survival rate decreases sharply after age 70.


7️⃣ What is the relationship between age and serum creatinine levels?

Serum creatinine levels increase with age,

The 71+ age group shows the highest average serum creatinine (1.27), indicating higher kidney stress and risk.


8️⃣ Which age group has the healthiest serum creatinine level?

The 40–50 age group has the lowest average serum creatinine (1.03), indicating better health.


9️⃣ How does ejection fraction vary across age groups?

61–70 years: Highest average ejection fraction (41.17)

51–60 years: 40.27

40–50 years: 38.53

71+ years: Lowest (around 42 but with low survival count)

👉 Better ejection fraction is linked with higher survival.


🔟 Which age group has the highest heart function performance?

The 61–70 age group shows the best heart performance based on ejection fraction and survival rate.


1️⃣1️⃣ How does smoking impact heart disease across age groups?

Smoking impact is highest in the 51–60 and 61–70 age groups, contributing significantly to heart disease risk.


1️⃣2️⃣ How does high blood pressure affect patients by age?

High blood pressure cases are most common in 51–60 and 61–70 age groups, increasing mortality risk.


1️⃣3️⃣ What is the impact of diabetes on heart disease outcomes?

Diabetes cases are more concentrated in middle-aged groups, negatively affecting survival chances.


1️⃣4️⃣ How does anaemia affect heart disease patients?

Anaemia contributes to increased risk, especially in older age groups, worsening survival outcomes.


1️⃣5️⃣ Which age group is the most critical and high-risk?

The 71+ age group is the most critical, with:

Lowest survival rate

Highest serum creatinine

Higher combined health risks


1️⃣6️⃣ What is the combined effect of lifestyle and medical conditions?

Patients with smoking habits, diabetes, high blood pressure, and anaemia show lower survival rates, especially at older ages.


1️⃣7️⃣ What key insight can be drawn for healthcare decision-making?

Early monitoring of serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and lifestyle factors can significantly improve survival chances.


1️⃣8️⃣ What business or medical recommendation comes from this dashboard?

Focus preventive care on 50–70 age group

Provide early intervention for high-risk patients

Promote lifestyle changes to improve survival
